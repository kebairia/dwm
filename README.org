is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.
*dwm* is created by the [[https://www.suckless.org][suckless.org]] community.
The patches I added to this build include:

- restartsig (allows dwm to be restarted with a keybinding)
- actualfullscreen (toggle fullscreen for a window, instead of toggling the status bar and the monocle layout)
- moveresize (allows you to move and resize dwm's clients using keyboard bindings)
- noborder (Remove the border when there is only one window visible)
- scratchpads (enables multiple scratchpads, the same scratchpad workflow in i3)

* Dependencies
- libxft or [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra/][libxft-bgra]]  (needed for colored emojis)
- ttf-fira-sans
- ttf-font-awesome (version 5)
- ttf-joypixels
- st (suckless terminal, checkout my personal build [[https://www.github.com/kebairia/st][HERE]])
- slstatus (suckless status bar)
- dmenu (app launcher)

Also, if you are building this on an Ubuntu-based system, you need to install ~libx11-dev~ and ~xorg-dev~.
* Installing dwm on Arch Linux

All you need to do is download this repository. Then run the following command:
#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://www.github.com/kebairia/dwm
  cd dwm
  sudo make install clean
#+end_src

*NOTE*: Installing dwm will overwrite your existing dwm installation.

* My Keybindings

The *MODKEY* is set to the Super key (aka the Windows key).
I try to keep the keybindings consistent with all of my window managers, but if you several of my window manager configs, there may be some discrepancies between them.

* Running dwm

If you do not use a login manager (such as lightdm) then you can add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

~exec dwm~

If you use a login manager (like lightdm), make sure that you have a file called dwm.desktop in your /usr/share/xsessions/ directory.
It should look something like this:

#+begin_src conf
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Dwm
Comment=Dynamic window manager
Exec=dwm
Icon=dwm
Type=XSession
#+end_src

* Configuring dwm

If you downloaded the source and built my dwm build yourself, then the source in the directory that you downloaded.
The configuration of dwm is done by editng the ~config.h~ and (re)compiling the source code.

~sudo make install~
